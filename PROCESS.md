## Day 5 (Fri):

# Week 2
## Day 8 (Mon):

* continued trying to make chat work, implementing different method that I found on firebase website themselves. Having a hard time figuring out how to make the chat one on one, rather than all users seeing the same chat. Also having problems retrieving information from segue, which I appear to be send properly so I have no clue why.
