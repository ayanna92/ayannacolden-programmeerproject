# Ayanna Colden Process Book

# Week 1
## Day 1 (Mon):
* Wrote proposal for M.A.D. app
* Watched Instagram like app tutorials and followed for firebase login/signup functionality and following users

## Day 2 (Tue): 
* Did research on chat functionality and started implementation

## Day 3 (Wed):
* Continuance chat functionality (watching tutorials, trying to find right one for swift 3 and my need for one on one chats)
* Design documentation made and handed in

## Day 4 (Thu):
* Continuance chat functionality and views
* Preparing for presentation on prototypes

## Day 5 (Fri):
* First presentation, feedback on needing to decide on contract method (if it will be in user chat, or have seperate vc)
* continuance chat functionality, having trouble with implementing this according to tutorial cause of differences (tutorial is using no storyboard code, which makes a lot of it confusing)
* having hard time figuring out how to read followers from firebase, so I can have a page where only followed users are listed to chat with

## Day 6 (Sat):
* Stuck on trying to get only followed users displayed in tableview, trying different things

## Day 7 (Sun):
* Took a break from apps for the day

# Week 2
## Day 8 (Mon):
* Fixed following user display problem, thanks to groupmate suggesting dispatch main async! SO HAPPY
* continued trying to make chat work, implementing different method that I found on firebase website themselves. Having a hard time figuring out how to make the chat one on one, rather than all users seeing the same chat. Also having problems retrieving information from segue, which I appear to be send properly so I have no clue why.

## Day 9 (Tue):
* WORKING CHAT, still suuper buggy and I have a lot of file cleaning up to do, and rid of viewcontrollers I'm not using. BUT my chat is functioning, and I'm very happy with this development. 

## Day 10 (Wed):
* Made chat less buggy, can now see profile images in navigation bar and profile images/names of users you're chatting with and can send images to each other
* Having a hard time saving images within chat itself, have tried using imagepicked variable, and placing it when user zooms in on message. But I need to figure out a way to fill variable with the url/img of the selected cell. Should ask about this tomorrow at SP, once this is done I can make the contracts, or at least the first contract view. 

## Day 11 (Thu):
* I can now save images from within chat between users! Still buggy in the sense that it's too tap sensitive and therefore saves images way too often
* debugged saving and zooming images in chat
* started on contract making viewcontroller: users can now upload two different images to make a contract. Still need to add images to firebase and save contract --> to contract tableview (needs to be made still)

## Day 12 (Fri):
* During presentations I saw one of classmates made a swipe menu in his app. Decided with the amount of viewcontrollers I have, a menu like that would make a lot of sense for me so plan on attempting to implement it this weekend. 
* Found useful tutorial on swipe menu and started following it
