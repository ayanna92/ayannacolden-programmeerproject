# Project Proposal
### Ayanna J. Colden

## M.A.D. 
Imagine having an embarrassing photo being taken of you on a night out, or during a vacation by one of your friends. You’re dreading the idea of the possibility that they’ll post this picture on the internet, so you’ll try to convince them to delete it. However, realistically in most friendships people have embarrassing information or photos of each other. So what if instead of freaking out about the embarrassing photo, there was a safe place where you and your friend could enjoy the embarassing photo's of eachother without anyone else seeing it? 

* what features will be available to solve the problem
  * Mutually assured destruction (M.A.D.), is a social media platform where friends can chat and upload embarrassing photos of each other. What makes M.A.D. different from other platforms, is that the photos in the newsfeed can only be viewed by the sender or the receiver. So your personal newsfeed is filled with embarrassing photos of yourself sent by your friends and embarrassing photos of your friends that that you've sent in return. 

      M.A.D. is a fun way for friends to assure between one another that neither will embarrass the other with photos or information on bigger social media platforms. By giving them a safe space to still enjoy these embarrassing photos together, and laugh amongst themselves.

* what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together
  * Login screen
  * Registration screen
  * Find users tableview, so you can follow users and start a chat with them
  * A chatlog where users can interact with each other and send embarrassing photos
  * A message tableview, where you see all conversations you're currently having
  * A newsfeed with images you have sent to your friends, and images they have sent to you
  * New message page, where you see a list of followed users and can start a conversation with them

* what external components (APIs) you probably need to make certain features possible
  * Firebase for user login and message/image storage functionality 
  * User Image uploading from device and saving image in application 
  * User interaction should be possible (they need to be able to speak to one another in app)
